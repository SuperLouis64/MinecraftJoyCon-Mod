# MinecraftJoyCon-Mod
Using the Titan Two or Cronus Zen you can play Minecraft by literally boxing! This doesn't mod minecraft itself but intercepts the Joy-Con's data to turn the motion of throwing punches into mining in Minecraft. Currently only the Titan Two method is uploaded but the CronusZen version is coming soon!

### Hardware Needed
This mod needs some hardware to get running. I have a full tutorial on my website if you need more information: <https://www.controllerbend.com/darksouls-ringfitmod.html>
- Titan Two Input Converter
- RingCon and Legstrap (not needed but helps)
- Titan Two Wireless Expansion Kit

### Software Needed
To interact with the Titan Two, you'll need to download Gtuner IV. "Gtuner IV is the main software for programming, updating and configuring the Titan Two device, featuring an complete IDE with integrated compiler for the GPC script language. Gtuner IV also provides user friendly interfaces for easy download, configure and use gamepacks or user made scripts. Based in a modern framework, Gtuner IV supports multi-platform, high resolution monitors and localization" - ConsoleTuner's site.
